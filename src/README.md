API_Energyner

API_Energyner is a tool designed to simplify complex energy calculations. This project integrates a robust backend and an interactive frontend to facilitate the automation of energy processes and the generation of energy footprints, providing an accessible solution for technicians and professionals in the energy sector.

Objective The objective of API_Energyner is to provide an efficient and precise platform for performing advanced energy calculations, reducing manual workload, and improving productivity in the energy sector.

Project Structure Backend: • energyServ.js: Main server file that manages the APIs. • footprint.js: Algorithm for energy footprint analysis. • package.json: Defines the project's dependencies and scripts. Frontend: • index.html: Main page for user interaction. • style.css: Styles applied to the interface design. • nav.js: Logic for dynamic communication and DOM manipulation.

Installation Installing the Backend

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/energyner/api_energyner
Access the project folder:
cd API_Energyner/backend
Install the dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then run:
npm install
Run the server: Start the server with:
node energyServ.js This will initialize the backend and make the APIs ready.
Installing the Frontend

Access the frontend folder:
cd ../frontend
Open the index.html file in a browser: The user can open the file in the browser in several ways: o From the file explorer: o Navigate to the frontend folder. o Double-click on the index.html file. o From the terminal: If you are in the frontend folder, execute the following command: o C:\Users[energyner]\api_energyner\frontend> start index.html
Additional Notes • Ensure the server is running before interacting with the frontend. • If you encounter problems, check the console messages in both the browser and the server to debug errors.

Done! Now you have API_Energyner working on your machine.
